Making work as simple as a chat

## Install

- `cp .env.example .env`

## Features 

**We integrate directly into the chat two kind of features:**
- Chat command: Similar than discord, start with a slash, and launch a action that here will lead to action on chain
- Custom render and CTA: Message that include some specific text are parsed and render with a custom designe included call to action 
Both allow a really easy way for users to do handle there collaboration directly from the chat.

**These are the features:**
- Command to create a gig: `/create-service Audit SmartContract for 10 MATIC`

- CTA to create automatically the proposal link to a gig
